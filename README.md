# The Green Table 


<br>


## Description

The Green Table is an app that is designed for the user who would like to get together with friends for a meal that is healthy, made with healthy and sustainable products. Keywords are sharing with friends, having a good time together, green living, and locally produced, organic or fair trade products. The user and many of their friends have chosen a sustainable way of living and make responsible choices that fit this way of life. They are vegetarians or vegans, often out of conviction. Some of them do not drink alcohol. They want to respect each others choices and preferences when having meals together.

The app offers the user (who can be either host or guest) the possibility to organise events, which are called 'tables'. The user who organises a table will automatically be the host of that table. The tables are on invitation basis, and only the host can invite guests. Both host and guests can see the preferences (i.e. vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, non-alcohol) of the user. The host sets the maximum for the number of guests, and the time and location for the table. A table can be breakfast, lunch, dinner, or drinks & bites. 

The central component of the app is the table page that offers the functionality to:

- choose the date when a user wants to create a table;
- indicate which dishes/drinks the user will bring as the host of the table;
- invite friends to the table;
- edit or cancel the table that has been organised.

When the user chooses a date to organise a table, they can search by name for the friends they want to invite. Only people who sign up for the app can be on the list of friends. The host can tick a box to indicate the type of food/drink they will bring themselves. The guests receive the invitation and can accept. The guests can indicate what they will bring. After creating the table, both host and guests can read the details by clicking on the list in their user profile. For the host, there is a button on the table form to cancel the event, and the guests will be informed automatically when the host cancels the table. The host can change the table and send a new invitation to the previously invited guests, with the option of adding a new guest. The guests will have to again accept the invitation to confirm they will attend. After accepting an invitation, the guest can cancel their attendance.

To use the app, someone has to sign up. They have to provide their username, city and email address, and set a password. They have to tick a box to agree with the privacy and liability statement of The Green Table. After signing up, the user can create their user profile with personal details (name and city) and their preferences regarding food and drink (vegetarian; vegan; gluten-free; non-alcoholic drinks). The user can upload a profile picture as well. The profile will show the tables hosted by the user, and the tables for which the user has accepted an invitation as guest (past and present). There are buttons to edit the user profile details (name, city, password, picture) and to delete the profile. The user can log out on the profile page.
